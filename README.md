### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Khmais (pronounced James, but try it in Spanish), Tunisian based in Halle (Saale), Germany. A self-taught front-end developer switching careers from Electrical Engineering to Web Development. 
I have two university degrees, first one was in Electrical Engineering which I got from a Tunisian university and the second one was a master degree in Photovoltaics from HS Anhalt - Deutschland.
I learned web development through online lectures, mainly from Udemy and Udacity websites, most of the help I get, as every developer, is from Google or Stackoverflow, but my fav is always the webdev subreddit in Reddit. Currently, I'm enrolled in a workshop where self taught React developers gather online and practice what they learned, this workshop is coordinated by <a href="https://www.redi-school.org/"> ReDi School </a> in Berlin.
